Polynomial Julia Set

The rule: find the set of all points Z s.t Z^5 + aZ^4 + bZ^3 + cZ^2 + dZ + e does not diverge
Reasoning behind the rule: Having no coefficient on the fifth order term ensures that there will be five sections of similiarity. The remaining coefficients shape the julia set.

For this specific fractal, the following parameters were used: 
a = -0.744 + 0.14i
b = +.49285 + -.37265i
c = 0 + 1i
d = .05 - .723i
e = .581 -.534i

However, you could put in any parameters to create a new julia set.

Area: ~ 1.042566710013889 - this was calculated by counting the pixels in the set
Perimeter: ???

Dimesion: 2.00353 (I'm pretty sure it just approaches 2 as I let resolution go to infinity, but I don't have the computing power)
